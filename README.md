Catch-A-Cat 

This game is based on the classic "Whack-A-Mole" game but with a twist...cats! It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game to is to try to 'catch' as many cats as you can before the timer runs out. The more cats you catch, the higher your score. 

Game functionality:  
* The 'Start' button starts the game, timer, and the appears/disappearance of cats
* There is a 10 second timer that counts down to 0
* The score is updated in real time each time a cat is successfully clicked on 
* The game ends when timer hits 0 seconds
* Player is presented with an alert dialogue stating that the game is over with the overall score
* Dimissing the 'Game over' dialogue box resets the game 
* Audio has been added for the cats to meow when successfully clicked on 

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the game.
